    "and organization of data. It is the science of making sense of numerical information or data in order to draw conclusions,\n",
    "make predictions, and inform decision-making. Statistics provides tools and techniques for summarizing, visualizing,\n",
    "and describing data, as well as for making inferences and testing hypotheses about populations based on samples. \n",

    "There are two main types of statistics: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.\n",

    "Descriptive Statistics:\n",
    "Descriptive statistics are used to summarize and describe the characteristics of a dataset. \n",
    "These statistics include measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of variability \n",
    "(range, variance, standard deviation). Descriptive statistics are used to get an overview of the data and to identify patterns\n",
    "or trends within the data. For example, a business might use descriptive statistics to analyze sales data to determine which \n",
    "products are selling the most, which regions are performing the best, and which time of year is the busiest for sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential Statistics:\n",
    "Inferential statistics are used to make inferences about a population based on a sample of data. \n",
    "These statistics allow researchers to test hypotheses and make predictions about the population using sample data. \n",
    "Inferential statistics include methods such as hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis. \n",
    "For example, a medical researcher might use inferential statistics to test a hypothesis that a new drug is more effective \n",
    "than an existing drug by comparing the results of a clinical trial with a control group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both types of statistics are important in data analysis, and often used together to gain a complete understanding of the data\n",
